video i'm making using Manim for #SoME4!!

it's about e (and exp() too ig (nerd)) and all the interesting things about it, like euler's identity, the limit of interest, and how e^x is its own derivative, and lastly why it's all cool

this video is gonna suck buns btw i have no clue how to use manim üôè

sorry for not picking a better topic, i don't have much time to make a video with all the other stuff i've got planned for this summer (both on and offline) so this will have to do. enjoy! (when it's done)
